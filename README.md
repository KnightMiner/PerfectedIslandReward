# Perfected Island Reward
This mod increases the amount of grid power given from the perfect island bonus from 2 to 3 to make it a more appealing option, as in vanilla the pilot is always superior (could just be sold for 2 reputation to buy 2 grid power after seeing shop options). Additionally, this mod adds a chance of getting a power core as a perfect island bonus. For more information, see the [forum thread](https://subsetgames.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=25&t=35504) on the Subset Games forum.
